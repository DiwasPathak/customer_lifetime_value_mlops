The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how [ZenML](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml) empowers your business to build and deploy machine learning pipelines in a multitude of ways:

- By offering you a framework and template to base your own work on.
- By integrating with tools like [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) for deployment, tracking and more
- By allowing you to build and deploy your machine learning pipelines easily
